    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The kind of people that are probably going to visit our web site are students or people that want to learn English for better job opportunities, improve their school grades, parents who want their small kids to learn etc. This is the type of people we want to keep in mind as we build the website, they want to know cost, time, and how do the classes take place or work pretty much people of any age might want to visit our webpage except small kids where itâ€™s more likely that their parents do the research people between 12 and 40- or 50-year-olds might visit our site. The colors and founts must help people easily see the costs, attract them to the parts where they can know how does our educational system work, and how to apply for it. When studying online people look for flexible hours, good and effective education that really helps them learn English, certificats, and well, everyone likes low costs they are... attractive smartphones or laptops will viste us. Those are the needs we need to cover. </p>
